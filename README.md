# PIWIGO TRANSFER SCRIPT

#### I have written a step-by-step guide called `PiwigoTransfer.docx` which contains all information needed for this script.

Mines' Media Production team moved stock assets from Deposit Photos to Piwigo. The task to manually move hundreds of photos from one site to another while including consistent liscencing and metadata is arduous, so this script does it automatically. It also contains a few extra tools to make inevitable manual fixes easier.

This tool has ended up saving many hours of burdensome work from the HIVE team, allowing a project that has been idle for months to be completed in only two days.
